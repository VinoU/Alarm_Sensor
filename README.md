### Correct web template usage

In the Beginning, I had created the repository for this project to uplaod all my work and I had ro create to index.md which where i upload what I every week. The Template provided my Project Instructor. And In Readme.md, I am doing build Instruction, I got template for this from my Professor sample Readme.md. My webpage built in md langauage. I published whatever i have done evey week.

1. Support control of DC and AC signals (AC 220V load).
2. Working voltage: 5V; PCB size: 2.0 x 4.3 cm.
3. With power light and signal output indicator.
4. A 3-pin anti-reverse cable included.

## Introduction using a system diagram

In E-money transfer, I am using relay module as my sensor. Iâ€™m using this sensor for security purposes. I am going to connect my relay module to raspberry pi3 and I also have a buzzer which is used to indicate the output of the relay module. The relay module will detect if the payment has done or not with the barcode created by my app from software. Once it detects that product has been stolen then the buzzer will go off indicating that the transaction has not been made. By this way we can prevent scamming.

![Schcdule]()
Normally, To built this Project it will take about a week but however It took me about two weeks complated everything fully. First,For parts arrival from amazon and It took me aboutt wo days. Between that time I was getting knownlage about my parts from []. To Mechanical Assembly. Secondly, I have spend about a day to assembled everything together. Because I was Working Software requriment and also builting PC Board, so that took me another two days.Thirdly, To make my sesnor work I have to write program and then that took my two days. I have worte thr program in Python. Finally, I have made my sensor connected to pi3. SO It was almost two weeks to complate entire project with all the spefication and requriment from Instructor.

## Mechanical Assembly

My Relay module sensor was acting like an alarm. TO built this, I was required raspberry platform and also a buzzer that indicate that output from relay. First, I  have installed respien OS on rasbperry pi3, so i can able to run the program to conect my module over the pi3. Secondly, I was connecting my Relay module to rapsberry for this connection, I connect the signal from relay module to GIO pin in Pi3. Secondly, I have to supply the power to my relay module so I was connecting 3.3v volatage pin in raspberry pi to the VCC in module (I AM PROVIDING 3.3V TO MY REALY MODULE BECAUSE IT IS A LOW LEVEL MODULE, THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL MODULE AND IT REQURIE 5V VCC PLEASE BE AWARE). And then I was coonecting a ground pin in pi3 to module ground so Now I was able to make a connection from my relay module and pi3. Finally, I was connecting my buzzer to my realy. so I connected the ground from buzzer to pi3 ground pin, and the signal from buzzer it connected to the relay module output, and then i provided 5V to the buzzer from raspberry pi3 pin and it started working as an alram when I ran my program.

## PCB / Soldering
I soldered PCB board to add more senors.
