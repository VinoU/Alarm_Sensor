## video

**I have made my 30 seconds of video and here is ths link for it**

In E-money transfer, I am using relay module as my sensor. Iâ€™m using this sensor for security purposes. I am going to connect my relay module to raspberry pi3 and I also have a buzzer which is used to indicate the output of the relay module. The relay module will detect if the payment has done or not with the barcode created by my app from software. Once it detects that product has been stolen then the buzzer will go off indicating that the transaction has not been made. By this way we can prevent scamming.

Report: 
I was able to show my parts that I purchased and the how I am connacting my sensor to  respberry pi3 and making them power up!

**Moment of Truth**

### Making LED BLINK works with Raspberry Pi3
### Scoure:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat.git
 cd StudentSenseHat/firmware
 gcc -Wall -o traffic2B traffic2B.c -lwiringPi
 sudo ./traffic2B
 ```

**Step 1:**
I have Connected my PC board to Rasbperry Pi3:
![image alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VinoU/Bar-QR-code-scanners/master/PCB%20On%20Pi3.jpg)<br>

**Step 2:**
Run Those Following Socure Code:
```
 git clone https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat.git
 cd StudentSenseHat/firmware
 gcc -Wall -o traffic2B traffic2B.c -lwiringPi
 sudo ./traffic2B
```

**Step 3:**
### Moment of Turth:
LED was Blinking order :

 ![Image alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VinoU/Bar-QR-code-scanners/master/Blinking%20pCb%202.jpg)<br>
 
**Report:**
I Connected pc to my Rasbperry and then I ran **traffic2B**  program and then LED was started to blinking from PC baord. When program says Red, the PCB LED was blinking Red and When program says Greed, the PCB LED was blinking green and also OFF.

### Making sensor work with Rasbperry Pi3:
**Step 1:**
From the Start Menu->Preferences->Raspberry Pi Configuration->Interfaces set I2C to Enabled.

**Step 2:**
```
 Shell
 make
 sudo ./ghmain
```
On Termnial<br>
![image alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VinoU/Bar-QR-code-scanners/master/output.jpg)

**Report:**

On Terminal, I connected the seonsors which are (light, tempatue humidity) working fine expect humidity. I ran the program called **ghmain**. and then light sensor detecting the light, Tempeature sensor was detecting the tempeature, and lastly the humidity was not detecting probaly. I am having some issue with Connection on P board.


**Isues with Programming code:**
We have fixed the isue with new Programming code and now it is running very smoothly. All the sensors are detecting probably.<br>

**Isues with PC board**
I had an isue with pc boad layout and then Kelly could able to fixed to for me . It was great expernices

### Connecting Pi3 first time

I have my PC Board Soldered and I made my Board working and now I need to connect to my Pc Board to Rapsiberry Pi.
I have tested with Vlad.<br>


Working With Raspberry pi3- Amazing Teachnology ever Built :O
2. I have installed the opearting system.

### PC Board

I had some issues while I was soldering. Then I got helped from Vlad and He was teaching my How to fix if the slodering is not in proper.

I had hard time putting resister on my PC board but after Vlad watching taching some trick then I was able to do it by myself. It was great!!!!
